# 13.1 - User-defined Data Types

## User-Defined Data Types

- **Necessity of User-Defined Types:**
    - Used when existing data types in a programming language do not meet specific program requirements.
    - Allow programmers to create new data types tailored to their needs.
    - Help in self-documenting code by grouping related data of different types into a single variable.
    - Can be divided into: Non-composite and composite data types

## Non-Composite Data Types

- These do not reference other data types.
- Examples:
    - **Enumerated Data Types (EDT):** Defined by a list of possible values with an implied order. Variables of this type can only be assigned one of those values. Useful for fixed lists like days of the week or directions.
    - **Pointer Data Types (PDT):** Hold memory addresses pointing to data of a specific type, allowing dynamic data structures and arithmetic on pointers.
- Pros:
    - Allow special-purpose data typing.
- Cons:
    - Language support might vary, particularly with pointers.

## Composite Data Types

- Constructed using other data types.
- Examples:
    - **Sets:** Collections of unordered unique elements with set operations like union and intersection.
    - **Classes/Objects:** Used in object-oriented programming to bundle data and methods.
    - **Records:** Fixed collections of components of differing types representing related data (e.g., a book record including title, author, pages).
- Programmers define these to match their program's data requirements precisely.

## Choosing and Designing User-Defined Data Types

- Identify the specific needs of the problem (e.g., what data must be stored and how it relates).
    
- Decide whether a non-composite or composite type fits best.
    
- Define enumerated types for fixed sets of values.
    
- Use records or classes to group different data items under one identifier.
    
- Example pseudocode for an enumerated type:
    
    ```
    textTYPE TDays = (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday)
    DECLARE Today : TDays
    Today = Wednesday
    ```
