# 13.2 - File-Organization and access

## File Organisation Methods

- **Serial File Organisation:** Records stored one after another in the order added, efficient for temporary transaction files; no sorting.
- **Sequential File Organisation:** Records stored in a sorted sequence based on a key field; allows efficient search stopping once passed the key.
- **Random File Organisation:** Records stored anywhere; location found by hashing the key field.

## File Access Methods

- **Sequential Access:** Read records one after another until a desired record is found; used with serial and sequential files.
- **Direct Access:** Jump directly to a record's location using an index (sequential files) or hashing (random files).

## Hashing Algorithms

- Mathematical formula to calculate file record address from the key field, typically by dividing the key and using the remainder.
- Collisions handled by:
    - Open hashing: placing records in the next free address.
    - Closed hashing: using overflow areas.
- Example: Address = (Key mod Number of records) + Start address.
