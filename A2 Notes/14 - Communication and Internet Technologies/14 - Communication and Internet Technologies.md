## What are protocol?
 - set of rule that enables communication between devices (from different manufacturers)

## Protocols as a "Stack"
- Structured in layers, with each layer responsible for a part of the communication process
- Data packets transferred one by one from top layer to bottom layer before being set sent off
- Each layer, which corresponds to specific rules and software to validate these rules operates independently

TCP/IP Protocol
- Enables computers to communicate over the internet
