# 14.1 - Protocols
## Intro & Structure
#####    - What are protocol?
#####    - TCP/IP Protocols
#####    - Common Protocols

---
## What are protocol?
- They set a standard for communication
 - set of rule that enables communication between devices (from different manufacturers)

## Protocols as a "Stack"
- Structured in layers, with each layer responsible for a part of the communication process
- Data packets transferred one by one from top layer to bottom layer before being set sent off
- Each layer, which corresponds to specific rules and software to validate these rules operates independently 

## TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol) Protocol
Enables computers to communicate over the internet and other networks

| **Application Layer**<br>	`- User Interface - Where the user submits data to be transmitted via web browser, etc`<br>	`- Security - Data is encrypted/secured for transmission`<br>	`- Translation - Data is translated/formatted for transmission over network`  <br><br>**Transport Layer**<br>	`- Segmentation - divides data into data packets`<br>	`- Sequencing - decides order in which packets will be transmitted, add this information to packet header`<br>	`- Received data from Application layer, sends packet to Network later`<br><br>**Network Layer**<br>	`- Decides optimum route through which packets will travel`<br>	`- Address packets with their source and destination IP address`<br>	`- Transmit packets down to Network Access (Physical/Data Link) layer`<br><br>**Network Access Physical/Data Link) layer**<br>	`- Turns data into raw signal to be transmitted over network`<br>	`- Controls rate at which data is transmitted`<br>	`- Responsible for physical connection(Wi-Fi, ethernet, etc.)` | ![](../Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250818192350.png) |

## Other Protocols
- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - used for sending and receiving webpages
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - used for sending and receiving files over networks
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - used for sending emails from a mail server using push protocol
- POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) - used for receiving and downloading emails from a mail server using pull protocol (Users must make request to see new emails)
- IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) - used for receiving and downloading emails from a mail server using push protocol (emails are automatically delivered to user)
- BitTorrent - peer-to-peer(P2P) file-sharing protocol used for distributing large files across the internet
	- Swarm Downloading - files are broken down into different pieces, which can be stored with different users but downloaded and assembled back together by a single user
- Host-to-host                       
-  a protocol used by TCP when communicating between two devices. 



outline protocol are essential for communication
state the name of 2 diff protocal involved for emails
bit torrent provides peer to peer file sharing
explain peer to peer

a seed uploads a file and makes it available for every one in the network
other peers who wish to download the data must obtain the torrent and connect to the server
once a peer has download a file


the torrent has metadata about the actual file
the actual file is broken down into pieces through segmentation
the seed uploads the file to the peer to peer network
anyone who wishes to download the file should obtain the torrent first
peers can both download and  upload to the netwrok 
the more the peers in the network, the faster and reliable the connection
