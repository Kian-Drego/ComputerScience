## What is packet switching?
 - A method by which data is transmitted across networks, including the Internet

 1. A file to be transmitted is divided into chunks called data packets.
 2. The packet is given a header with information about its path and a payload which contains the actual data to be transmitted.
 3. Each packet is sent into the network independently and may take a different path to its destination computer (indicated by an IP address)
 4. Packets arrive out of order but are reassembled according to a sequence number included in the header.
 5. If any packets are missing, a request for retransmission is sent back to the destination IP address.

The Data packet

| Header (12 bytes)     | Data (112 bytes)                        | Footer (4 bytes)       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| - address of sender   | Actual data to be transmitted (Payload) | - transmission codes   |
| - address of receiver |                                         | - error checking codes |
| - protocol            |                                         | - control bits         |
| - sequence number     |                                         |                        |
