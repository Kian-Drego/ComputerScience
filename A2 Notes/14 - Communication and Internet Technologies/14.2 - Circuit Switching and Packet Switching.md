# Packet Switching - 

## What is packet switching?
 - A method by which data is transmitted across networks, including the Internet

 1. A file to be transmitted is divided into chunks called data packets.
 2. The packet is given a header with information about its path and a payload which contains the actual data to be transmitted.
 3. Each packet is sent into the network independently and may take a different path to its destination computer (indicated by an IP address)
 4. Packets arrive out of order but are reassembled according to a sequence number included in the header.
 5. If any packets are missing, a request for retransmission is sent back to the destination IP address.

## The Data packet

Figure 1: The structure of a data packet

| Header (12 bytes)   | Data (112 bytes)                        | Footer (4 bytes)     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| address of sender   | Actual data to be transmitted (Payload) | transmission codes   |
| address of receiver |                                         | error checking codes |
| protocol            |                                         | control bits         |
| sequence number     |                                         |                      |

## Roles of Router in Packet Switching
- Analyses packet header
- Uses knowledge of status of network and destination to calculate current optimum route and send packet to next appropriate router

## Advantages and Disadvantages

| Advantages                                                                                                                    | Disadvantages                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Security - packets hashed and sent by different routes                                                                        | Network problems may lead to errors in data packets |
| Resilience - if a router is down or network is damages, packets can simply change route                                       | Complexity                                          |
| Completeness - missing packets can easily be detected (via sequence number) and a resend request made to IP address of origin |                                                     |


# Circuit Switching
What is circuit switching?
- A method by which data is transmitted over networks using an exclusive, dedicated path for a transmission between two devices 

1. Dedicated path established between sender and receiver
2. Resources, including necessary bandwidth are allocated to circuit, which is used in its entirety
3. Once path is established, data can be transferred back and forth between sender and receiver
4. Session is terminated and route is once again free for communication between other senders and receivers

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Consistency - Data frames arrive in order and therefore do not need to be reassembled | Less secure - same route used for all data frames that make up a message                                             |
| Speed - No delay in data transmission                                                 | Inefficient - resources are allocated and route is reserved regardless of whether data is actively being transmitted |
| Simplicity                                                                            |                                                                                                                      |
