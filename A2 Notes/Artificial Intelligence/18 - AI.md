## Intro To AI
- AI is a system that attempts to solve problems by simulating how the human brain works
- Supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Learning

## Supervised Learning
- Supervised Learning uses "Labelled Data"
- The machine learning algorithm is given the categorized or "labelled" input and output data.
- Feed the machine new, unlabelled information to see if it tags new data appropriately. If not, continue refining the algorithm

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from data that has been manually labelled with the correct answers. After training on these labelled examples, the model is then able to make accurate predictions on future outcomes based on the past data.

- Problems which its suited to:
	CLASSIFICATION
		Sorting items into categories

	REGRESSION
		Identifying real values (dollars, weight, etc.)

## Unsupervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning does not require and prior training with the correct data (labelled data)
- It only requires input data to be given
- Unlabelled data is fed through the machine where it is divided into different categories, (The categories are not labelled by the machine)
